                    This site was created as project for a web development course. During the whole
                    process all the
                    content, design choices, and page layouts were made from scratch using basic web technologies like
                    HTML,
                    CSS, and
                    JavaScript. This
                    site showcases how the technical skills learnt in this course were applied to a topic of cultural
                    matter.
